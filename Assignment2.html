      <h2>Key Terms</h2>
      <div class="keyterm">
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          The inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent
          interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by
          people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and
          socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="keyterm">
        <h3>Client</h3>
        <p>
          The client, or user, side of the Web. It typically refers to the Web
          browser in the user's machine.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="keyterm">
        <h3>Domain Name</h3>
        <p>A Domain Name is a unique label for an entity of the internet.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="keyterm">
        <h3>DNS</h3>
        <p>
          The Domain Name System organizes the internet by identifying the
          address and type of entity. It also converts domain names into IP
          addresses that can be understood by machines comprising the Internet.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="keyterm">
        <h3>FTP</h3>
        <p>
          The File Transfer Protocol is a set of rules that for exchanging files
          over the internet. Unlike HTTP which is used to ask for the entire
          webpage and it's files to display them, FTP is used only to move a
          file from one computer to another. FTP is commonly used by web
          developers when they want to tranfer their local files from their
          computer to the server and vice versa.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="keyterm">
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
          Hypertext Markup Language is the language used for creating web pages
          and web applications. HTML has a specified tag set for semantically
          describing the structure of a web page. HTML elements are the building
          blocks of a web page and are defined by tags written using angle
          brackets.
        </p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="keyterm">
        <h3>HTTP</h3>
        <p>
          Web browsers and web servers communicate using hyperttext transfer
          protocol. HTTP has rules for exchanging different types of files like
          text, images, audio, and video. When a browser is directed to a
          hyperlink, an HTTP request is built and sent to the server of that URL
          which then processes the request and responds by sending the requested
          files.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="keyterm">

          in the Internet and other packet-switched networks. IPv4 was the first version 
          deployed for production on SATNET in 1982 and on the ARPANET in January 1983.

          TCP works with the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how computers send packets of data
           to each other. Together, TCP and IP are the basic rules defining the Internet.

        <h4>
          When is it ok to use images,audio, or video,created by someone else?
        </h4>
        <p>

      <div class="question">
        <h4>What are 3 ways to make websites more accessible?</h4>
        <p>
          Use the alt attribute to describe images, use descriptive links, provide a text navigation at 
          the bottom of the page, and use semantic tags like h1, heading, footer.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h4>Why should you put extra effort into making websites more accessible?</h4>
        <p>
          Providing access for visitors with visual, auditory, and other challenges should be an integral 
          part of web design rather than an afterthought. It's the right thing to do and in some cases 
          it's the law.
        </p>
